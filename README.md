# vue_phone_book
We provided some simple Vue.js template code (Fork from this project). Your goal is to create a simple form at the top that allows the user to enter in a first name, last name, and phone number and there should be a submit button. Once the submit button is pressed, the information should be displayed in a list below (automatically sorted by first name) along with all the previous information that was entered. This way the application can function as a simple phone book. When your application loads, the input fields (not the phone book list) should be prepopulated with the following values already: 

- Haley Prichet (019232323)
- John Wick (0195873473)
- Micheal Jordan (0195873471)
- Son Goku (0195873470)

Grade will be provided based on:
1. Run without error or warning
2. Able to get result as expected
3. Good structure coding style
4. Good history and commit changes
5. Bonus : Provide unit test. 

You will need to provide:
1. Github url containing your answer for this project
2. Screenshot of output.
